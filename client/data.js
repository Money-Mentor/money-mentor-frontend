    description: `A close cousin of the social value spender, the “splasher” is more likely to be male and tends to spend money on others very visibly, Ms Hammond says. For example, they may declare at the beginning of a meal in a restaurant that they are going to cover the bill. The occasion is then “all about them, and how nice and generous they are,” she says, noting this is “entirely different to going up and paying for something quietly.”
    People who recognise these traits should realise that “spending does not make you happier if it is being done to show off”, says Ms Hammond.
    True contentment, she adds, can be achieved by spending money on experiences one intrinsically enjoys — and they do not have to be expensive. Take your children for a picnic, listen to grandma tell her stories, or cook your friends a meal. “The motivation should be the connection with others, and not what doing a certain thing will look like on social media,” she says.`

    description: ` Does shopping make you happy? Do you frequently buy your loved ones presents “just because” and blow the budget at Christmas and birthdays? You could be a social value spender, which the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute defines as someone who makes purchases (either for themselves or others) to boost their self-esteem.
    With consumer debt at record levels, if you are concerned about your spending and borrowing habits you need to study your bills — perhaps with the support of a close friend. Work out how much you are spending on impulse, and the interest on any debts. Switch to a zero-rate deal and work out how much you need to pay a month to clear the balance within the offer period, then budget accordingly.`

    Motivate yourself by putting your saving towards a reward, such as a holiday. As you become more confident, consider approaching a financial planner to discuss longer term investments and pensions.`
